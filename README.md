###Plans for future Updates:  
**Timer:**  
- [ ] Allow people to compare how quickly they can finish a level  


**Loading screen:**  
- [ ] Ensure no frustration occurs from thinking you can play but being delayed while assets are loaded  

**Multiple lobbies:**  
- [ ] Allow players to join a lobby to play with their friends, allows games to actually end instead of continously running
